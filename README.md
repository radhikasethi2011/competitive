Important short points to remember/what I come across

<details>
<summary>Graph theory</summary>
<br>
   
* Handshaking Lemma : <br>
    *  `Sum of Degrees of vertex = 2 * |Number of Edges| `
    * Number of vertexes with odd egrees will always be even
    * for ex: assert(<return value from the function>==<actual answer>)
    *  If the answer is wrong, it gives an `AssertationError` on terminal - and the program terminates.
